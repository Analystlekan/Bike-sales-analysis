# Bike Sales Dashboard

## Introduction

In this data analysis project, I have created a comprehensive Excel dashboard to analyze bike sales based on various customer demographics and attributes. The dataset includes information about marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, number of cars, commute distance, region, age, and whether the customer purchased a bike. The goal of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify key factors that influence bike purchases.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- **Marital Status**: The marital status of the customer (e.g., single, married).
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Income**: The annual income of the customer.
- **Children**: The number of children the customer has.
- **Education**: The highest level of education attained by the customer.
- **Occupation**: The occupation of the customer.
- **Home Owner**: Whether the customer owns a home.
- **Cars**: The number of cars owned by the customer.
- **Commute Distance**: The distance the customer commutes to work.
- **Region**: The region where the customer lives.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Purchased Bike**: Whether the customer purchased a bike (yes/no).

## Tools and Software

For this project, I used Microsoft Excel as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization. Excel provides a versatile and accessible platform for performing data analysis, creating charts, and building interactive dashboards.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Excel Dashboard**: The complete data analysis process, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
2. **Visualizations**: A variety of charts and graphs to support key findings and insights.
3. **Final Report**: A comprehensive summary of the analysis, insights, and recommendations.

## Visualizations

1. **Customer Commute Distance**: A bar chart showing the distribution of customers based on their commute distance.


2. **Average Income per Purchase**: A bar chart showing the average income of customers who purchased a bike.
 

3. **Customer Age Bracket**: A bar chart showing the distribution of customers across different age brackets.

## Conclusion

This data analysis project in Excel provides valuable insights into bike sales and customer demographics. The interactive visualizations help in understanding various aspects of customer behavior, such as commute distance, income, and age. By the end of the project, we aim to uncover actionable recommendations that can drive improvements in sales strategies and enhance customer targeting, all within the user-friendly environment of Excel.
